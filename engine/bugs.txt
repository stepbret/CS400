Bugs:
   1. Can double jump/ mess up jumping
   2. jumping is too slow/seems off
   3. Hit detection is off
   4. ground and sky generation are not great and need to replace the randomization
   5. Seg faults on hit detection of any object outside the first one in the vector

Need to add:
   1. Add network getting
   2. Missle generation and detection
